The world is upside down, people are sad and depressed. The Covid-19 situation has been impacting our mental health.

There are no visible symptoms for mental health. NO VISIBLE SYMPTOMS.

Taking care of mental health is something that only you can do.

Whatever you are going through, just remember that youâ€™re not alone. Talk with somebody, talk with a mental health professional.
