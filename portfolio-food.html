description: Cooking and baking are also ways to create. When I'm cooking or baking I feel like Iâ€™m painting on a canvas and I can play with flavours, smells, tastes and colours, and I can create and share memories with my friends, family and especially with my daughters. I put my secret ingredient in every recipe - Love!
